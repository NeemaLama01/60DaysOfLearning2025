# ðŸŒŸ 60 Days of Learning: AI/ML Journey (2025)

I'm committing to the 60DaysOfLearning2025 challenge as part of the **#LearningWithLeapfrog** community.
Although I already have a foundational understanding of Python, math, and core AI/ML concepts, over the next 60 days, I'll be exploring **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** from scratch, relearning something new every day, from core concepts i.e python, maths to hands-on projects from the ground up.


This journey isnâ€™t about starting from zero but it's about refining, deepening, and reinforcing what I know, correcting past gaps, and discovering new angles. From theory to real-world projects, I'm treating this like a fresh start with a learner's mindset.
